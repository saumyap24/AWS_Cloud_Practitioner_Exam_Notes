## What is cloud computing?
--- 
- Cloud computing is <b><i> on-demand </i></b> delivery  of compute power, database, storage, applications and other IT resources thorugh a cloud services platform 
- <b> <i>pay-as-you-go pricing</i></b>
- provides rapid -access and low-cost IT resources 
- as many resources as you need and get instantly and only pay what you use


## Advantages of cloud computing
---

- <b> Pay as you go - </b> pay only when you use computing devices and only for how much you use
- <b> </b>

- SAAS
    - offers services meant to be used by end users
    - example - Google's gmail service
    - AWS SAAS products
        - Simple Email service
        - Amazon workspaces 
- PAAS
    - hides the complexity of the infrastructure that runs it
    - often includes code that will the run the application 
    - AWS PAAS products
        - Elastic Beanstalk
        - Elastic container service (ECS)
- IAAS
    - direct access to a provider's compute, storage and networking resources
    - AWS IAAS products 
        - Elastic cloud compute (EC2) for virtual machine instances
        - Elastic Block Store (EBS) for storage
        - Elastic load Balancing
